## SecBERT Fine-Tuning for Severity Classification

This script fine-tunes a SecBERT model to classify the severity impact of software vulnerabilities (CVEs) based on their textual descriptions. It provides a complete end-to-end pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Key Features

* Local Data Loading: Ingests CVE data from a nested directory of JSON files. 
* Text Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes raw CVE text by combining title and description fields for a richer input. 
* Model Fine-Tuning: Uses the Hugging Face Trainer API to fine-tune the jackaduma/SecBERT model, a BERT variant specialized for security text. It includes a fallback to bert-base-uncased if SecBERT is unavailable. 
* Hardware Optimization: Automatically detects and utilizes the best available hardware, with specific optimizations for CUDA GPUs and Apple Silicon (MPS). 
* Evaluation: Measures model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, a detailed classification report, and a visual confusion matrix. 
* Prediction: Includes a simple interface to predict the severity of new, unseen vulnerability descriptions.

## Process flow

* Load & Preprocess: The script recursively scans a specified directory for .json files, loading each as a CVE record. It then cleans the data, combines text fields, and standardizes the severity labels (e.g., "Critical", "Important"). 
* Prepare Datasets: The preprocessed data is split into training, validation, and test sets, maintaining the original distribution of severity classes. 
* Train: The SecBERT model is fine-tuned on the training set. The process includes early stopping to prevent overfitting and saves the best-performing model. 
* Evaluate: The trained model's accuracy and per-class performance are calculated against the unseen test set. A confusion matrix is saved as secbert_confusion_matrix.png. 
* Save & Predict: The final model, tokenizer, and label encoder are saved to the ./secbert_model directory, ready for inference on new data.

## building

If ml python dependencies have been installed then build model by

```commandline
cd src/aegis_ai_ml
make classifier
```
